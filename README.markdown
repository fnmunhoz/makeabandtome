# Overview

This project is based on an ideia I saw on a friend's Facebook page:

1. Go to wikipedia.org and click on 'random page'. The first article's tile wich apears will be your band's name;

2. Go to quotationspage.com and click on 'random quotes' The last four or five words on the last quote will be your band's first album title;

3. On flickr.com's 'last 7 days', the first photo that appears will be your first albun's cover.

4. Put it all togheter.
